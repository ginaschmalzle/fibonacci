Fibonacci Sequence Done Iteratively and Recursively
======================================================

This repo contains files for writing how to find the nth Fibonacci number in many different ways.  My first goal was to convert my initial, very non-functional way of programming to more functional using the iterative technique.  Then I looked at the differences in timing between writing the code iteratively and recursively in Python.
